In the event that a supplier defaults prior to providing the service to you for which payment has been made, the sole recourse for refund shall be with the defaulting supplier, from insurance covering such defaults if any or from other responsible third party unless such was caused by Ansglobaltours.com. In those situations in which a supplier defaults prior to providing services you may pursue any recourse against the supplier for refund, which may be permitted by law or statute. Ansglobaltours.com warrants that it provides the highest standards of service in the trade and will use appropriate care in selecting suppliers so as to protect you from such default.

Discounts offered may vary depending on a number of factors including Airlines utilized, class of service, destination, time of year (low, mid or high season), advance notice provided, minimum stay requirements fulfilled and flight load.
